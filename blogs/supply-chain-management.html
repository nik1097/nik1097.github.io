                    <strong>The word "Supply Chain" was first used in 1905 during the war-plagued era. Featured in an article 
                    about wartime situation in the famous newspaper "The Independent".</strong> Gaining mainstream recognition 
                    during the mid-1990's, the term Supply Chain Management is now a commonly used word in almost all industries 
                    and companies ranging from small to big.

                    Blockchain has its roots as a concept in Computer Science primarily, in the field of cryptography and 
                    data structures before being used in cryptocurrency. It allows consumers and suppliers to connect directly, 
                    removing the need for a third party such as a bank. It acts as a chain of blocks that contains information as 
                    its name suggests.

                    Supply chain management is the practice of incorporating a company's social, environmental and economic 
                    goals into the coordination of inter-business processes to improve the long-term economic performance of 
                    the individual company and its supply chains.

                    SCM cuts little or no slack for errors as it has to meet the growing needs of the consumers.

                    A two-way communication between the supplier and the consumer is critical as it creates visibility of 
                    demand and fast detection of problems. Supply Chain Managers are required to take decisions on what to make, 
                    buy and sell. Moving the product back also plays a key role in case of damage, repair, recycling or return.
