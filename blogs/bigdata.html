                    <strong>From a long time, human beings have been gathering and storing large amounts of information for eventual 
                    analysis.</strong>
                    The Big data concept gained relevance in the early 2000s and has been growing ever since, as the world 
                    is adopting digital technology.
                </p>
                <p class="read-blog-content">
                    A large amount of data is collected from devices like computers, tablets and mobile phones. 
                    This user information is used by organizations to improve our standard of living. In the future, 
                    almost all the objects around us will be used to collect and transmit data in order to produce better 
                    and more efficient products.

                    Big Data is a massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is so large it is difficult 
                    to process using traditional database and software techniques.
                </blockquote>
                <p class="read-blog-content">
                    Large amounts of unstructured or time-sensitive data cannot be processed by relational database engines. 
                    Big data concept is used instead of traditional data handling concepts such as data mining. As constraints 
                    on computation power and memory have reduced in recent times, big data is growing rapidly.

                    The main goal of big data is to turn this large collection of data into useful information. The importance 
                    of big data doesn't revolve around how much data you have, but what you do with it.
                    The internet plays a key role in big data as it provides large amounts of raw data for systems to analyze. 
                    This leads to a reduction in costs, increased production efficiency, product evolution and smarter decision 
                    making systems.

                <p class="read-blog-content">
                    Supercomputers and algorithms help us analyze these large sets of data in real time. This analysis reveals 
                    patterns and connections that help us arrive at a particular decision. Big data offers various tools for 
                    this operation. Hadoop is one such tool which is an open source, Java-based programming framework that 
                    supports the processing and storage of extremely large data sets in a network.

                <p class="read-blog-content">
                    Big data often uses AI and ML techniques to identify the type of data it is storing. 
                    Data can include photos, videos, sound recordings, written text and sensor data. As data grows larger the 
                    systems can arrive at more accurate conclusions and predict outcomes faster.

                    Big data is being used in many fields such as medicine, crime detection, weather stations, traffic control 
                    mechanism, social networking sites, etc. The possible applications of this concept are vast, we are only 
                    beginning of this concept.  Keeping up with big data technology is an ongoing challenge as many new tools 
                    are being introduced to provide better analytics.
