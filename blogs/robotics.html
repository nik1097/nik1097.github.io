                    <strong>In the last two decades or so, robots have been widely used in 
                    industries to replace human effort. They are also portrayed in sci-fi movies as humanoids, so what 
                    exactly are robots and what is robotics based on?</strong> This article aims to give you a sneak peek 
                    into the field of robotics.

                    The concept of robotics is derived from the fields of electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, 
                    mechatronics, nanotechnology, and bioengineering. Hence, robotics forms a derived field of engineering. 
                    In simple terms, a robot is literally a "slave".

                    Robotics is the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of computer programmable machines 
                    that are capable of carrying out series of actions automatically.

                    Robotics primarily focuses on automation. A robot is a device which performs tasks automatically 
                    without repeatedly being programmed or changed. It is initially programmed and an instruction set is 
                    provided to them to automate a particular task. It performs the specified sequence of operations 
                    repeatedly with the same accuracy.

                    Basics of electronics play a major role in the development of robots. It is important to understand the 
                    workings of components like motors, actuators, sensors, etc. before we design a robot. The design and 
                    assembling of a robot is crucial to provide an aesthetic and a clean build. Microcontrollers such as Arduino 
                    boards, raspberry pi's coupled with coding can get you started with your robots. Generally, C/C++ is preferred 
                    over other coding languages as they allow interaction with low-level hardware and a real-time performance.

                    Robotics heavily relies on physics, probability, and linear algebra. Linear algebra and physics are pivotal 
                    for laying out matrices which help in the movement of robots. Probability plays a key role in machine learning 
                    and AI algorithms, making it very important to have a strong foundation in the above-mentioned subjects.

                    Robots are generally given the form of humanoids in most sci-fi movies, practically speaking a robot can 
                    have any physical form. Robotic arms are widely used in automobile industries, although the arm doesn't move, 
                    it facilitates the displacement of objects and hence can be classified as a robot. A vacuum cleaner which can 
                    automatically detect and clean dirt in a room without being asked to or guided can also be considered as a 
                    robot.

                    Most cloud computing companies offer a user-friendly GUI to manage their services and subscriptions.
                    A few others also offer a Command Line Interface and also the ability to work with API's giving developers
                    a multitude of options.

                    Robotics is a vast area in engineering and requires a fair amount of expertise as it is a derived application. 
                    It is important to identify your area of interest in the field of robotics and work towards it by reading 
                    the prototypes and design of existing robots before implementing your own robot. Robots can be used to work in 
                    dangerous and delicate environments with a great efficiency and reduced risks.
